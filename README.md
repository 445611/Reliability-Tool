# Reliability-Tool
A tool for software reliability analysis using GitHub repositories.

A practical part of the thesis will consist of a tool that would allow automated reliability analysis of the projects hosted on GitHub using the selected Software Reliability Growth Models (SRGMs). The input data for the model will be collected from the issue tracker of the GitHub projects.
